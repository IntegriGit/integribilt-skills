# multi-agent-patterns

This skill should be used when the user asks to "design multi-agent system", "implement supervisor pattern", "create swarm architecture", "coordinate multiple agents", or mentions multi-agent patterns, context isolation, agent handoffs, sub-agents, or parallel agent execution.

## What I do
Multi-agent architectures distribute work across multiple language model instances, each with its own context window. When designed well, this distribution enables capabilities beyond single-agent limits. When designed poorly, it introduces coordination overhead that negates benefits. The critical insight is that sub-agents exist primarily to isolate context, not to anthropomorphize role division.

## How to use me
Activate this skill when:
- Single-agent context limits constrain task complexity
- Tasks decompose naturally into parallel subtasks
- Different subtasks require different tool sets or system prompts
- Building systems that must handle multiple domains simultaneously
- Scaling agent capabilities beyond single-context limits
- Designing production agent systems with multiple specialized components

## Tools I use
- Standard IntegriBilt MCP tools
